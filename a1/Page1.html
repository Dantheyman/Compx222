      What's the point of HTTP
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the name suggests HTTP is the protocol used for the transfer of Hypertext documents over the internet.
      It is the foundation of data exchange on the web. HTTP can also be used to fetch images and video as
      well as sending content back to servers like with HTML forms. HTTP is Server-client based with the web
      browser generally acting as the client. Clients and servers communicate via individual messages.
      These messages are called requests when the clients send them and responses when the server sends them.
      The Clients are always the one initiating the requests not the servers<span class="citation">(Mozilla,2022a)</span>.

       History of HTTP
     </h2>
     <p>
       The first documented version of HTTP was created by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN between 1989-1991.
       The first documented version was released in 1991.
        Later named V0.9 was much simpler than later versions.
        It only had one method, GET followed by the path to the file.
        The response would simply be the file requested.   Unlike later versions there was also no HTTP
        header so only html files could be transferred. HTTPS was created as an encrypted version of HTTP 
        to be more secure. It was created in 1995 but not being widely used until recently.
        HTTP is an extentiable protocol being updated over time with the most widely adopted version currently being v1.1<span class="citation">(Mozilla,2022b)</span>..
