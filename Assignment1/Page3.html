      What is a request?
    </h1>
    <p>
    A HTTP request is made by a client,to a host, which is located on a server.
    The purpose of a request is to get access to a resource located on the server.
    The method used for the request then determines the interaction between the client and the resource.

      </ul>

   <div>
     <h2> Request line </h2>
     <p>The Request line consists of at least 3 items<span class="citation">(IBM,2021)</span>. </p>
       <dl>
          <dt>A method.</dt>
          <dd>
            The method is a one word command that instructs the server what the client wants done to the resource.
            E.g. The client could ask the server to send that particular resource to the client.
          </dd>
          <dt>The path</dt>
          <dd>
            The path component for the URL of the server. The path identifies where to find the resource on the  server.
          </dd>
          <dt>The HTTP Version number. </dt>
          <dd>
            Letting the server know the HTTP specification that the  request is complying too.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Additional items a request line might include are.
        </p>
        <dl>
         <dt>Query String.</dt>
          <dd>
            This provides a string that the resource can use for some process. It is put after the Path
            and is preceded by a question mark.
          </dd>
          <dt>The Scheme and host components of the URL.</dt>
          <dd>
            This is also known as the absolute URL. For some versions of HTTP if the Scheme and host components aren’t
            included in the request then they must be included in a Host header.
          </dd>
        </dl>
     </div>
     <div>   
       <h2> Request headers </h2>
       <p>
         Headers are written on requests to provide the recipient information from the sender about the message or
         the way it wants to communicate.
         This influences the way the recipient will respond to the sender. A Header consists of a name and a value(IBM,2021).
        </p>
      </div>  
      <div>
      <h2>Message body</h2>
        <p>
          The Message body contains the entity body which is the actual content of the request.
          Not all requests have a message body. For example POST method has a message body consisting
          of the information being sent to the server while a GET request has no data to send so does not
          have a message body<span class="citation">(IBM,2021)</span>.
        </p>

    <h2>Error Codes</h2>
    <p>
      Evey request that is sent to a server is responded with a HTTP status code.
      Some of  these are used to identify errors. According to <span class="citation">Anicas(2021)</span> common error codes include
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>400 - Bad Request</dt>
        <dd>
          Occurs when the request sent has invalid syntax
        </dd>
        <dt>401-Unauthorized</dt>
        <dd>
          Occurs when either the client trying to gain access to the resource
          hasn’t been authenticated by the server or hasn’t been authenticated correctly.
        </dd>
        <dt>404 - Not Found</dt>
        <dd>
           Occurs when even though the client can communicate with the server
           it is unable to find the requested resource.
        </dd>
        <dt> 502 - Bad Gateway</dt>
        <dd>
          Occurs when the server is unable to connect to its backend servers that actually fulfill the request.
        </dd>
      </dl>
